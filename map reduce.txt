1) What is Hadoop Map Reduce?

For processing large data sets in parallel across a Hadoop cluster, Hadoop MapReduce framework is used.  Data analysis uses a two-step map and reduce process.

2) How Hadoop MapReduce works?

In MapReduce, during the map phase, it counts the words in each document, while in the reduce phase it aggregates the data as per the document spanning the entire collection. During the map phase, the input data is divided into splits for analysis by map tasks running in parallel across Hadoop framework.

3) Explain what is shuffling in MapReduce?

The process by which the system performs the sort and transfers the map outputs to the reducer as inputs is known as the shuffle

4) Explain what is distributed Cache in MapReduce Framework?

Distributed Cache is an important feature provided by the MapReduce framework. When you want to share some files across all nodes in Hadoop Cluster, Distributed Cache is used.  The files could be an executable jar files or simple properties file.

5) Explain what is NameNode in Hadoop?

NameNode in Hadoop is the node, where Hadoop stores all the file location information in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).  In other words, NameNode is the centerpiece of an HDFS file system.  It keeps the record of all the files in the file system and tracks the file data across the cluster or multiple machines

6) Explain what is JobTracker in Hadoop? What are the actions followed by Hadoop?

In Hadoop for submitting and tracking MapReduce jobs,  JobTracker is used. Job tracker run on its own JVM process

Job Tracker performs following actions in Hadoop

Client application submit jobs to the job tracker
JobTracker communicates to the Name mode to determine data location
Near the data or with available slots JobTracker locates TaskTracker nodes
On chosen TaskTracker Nodes, it submits the work
When a task fails, Job tracker notifies and decides what to do then.
The TaskTracker nodes are monitored by JobTracker
7) Explain what is heartbeat in HDFS?

Heartbeat is referred to a signal used between a data node and Name node, and between task tracker and job tracker, if the Name node or job tracker does not respond to the signal, then it is considered there is some issues with data node or task tracker

8) Explain what combiners are and when you should use a combiner in a MapReduce Job?

To increase the efficiency of MapReduce Program, Combiners are used.  The amount of data can be reduced with the help of combiner’s that need to be transferred across to the reducers. If the operation performed is commutative and associative you can use your reducer code as a combiner.  The execution of combiner is not guaranteed in Hadoop

9) What happens when a data node fails?

When a data node fails

Jobtracker and namenode detect the failure
On the failed node all tasks are re-scheduled
Namenode replicates the user's data to another node
10) Explain what is Speculative Execution?

In Hadoop during Speculative Execution, a certain number of duplicate tasks are launched.  On a different slave node, multiple copies of the same map or reduce task can be executed using Speculative Execution. In simple words, if a particular drive is taking a long time to complete a task, Hadoop will create a duplicate task on another disk.  A disk that finishes the task first is retained and disks that do not finish first are killed.

11) Explain what are the basic parameters of a Mapper?

The basic parameters of a Mapper are

LongWritable and Text

13) Explain what is a difference between an Input Split and HDFS Block?

The logical division of data is known as Split while a physical division of data is known as HDFS Block

14) Explain what happens in text format?

In text input format, each line in the text file is a record.  Value is the content of the line while Key is the byte offset of the line. For instance, Key: longWritable, Value: text

15) Mention what are the main configuration parameters that user need to specify to run MapReduce Job?

The user of the MapReduce framework needs to specify

Job’s input locations in the distributed file system

17)  Explain what is Sqoop in Hadoop?

To transfer the data between Relational database management (RDBMS) and Hadoop HDFS a tool is used known as Sqoop. Using Sqoop data can be transferred from RDMS like MySQL or Oracle into HDFS as well as exporting data from HDFS file to RDBMS

18) Explain how JobTracker schedules a task?

The task tracker sends out heartbeat messages to Jobtracker usually every few minutes to make sure that JobTracker is active and functioning.  The message also informs JobTracker about the number of available slots, so the JobTracker can stay up to date with wherein the cluster work can be delegated

19) Explain what is Sequencefileinputformat?

Sequencefileinputformat is used for reading files in sequence. It is a specific compressed binary file format which is optimized for passing data between the output of one MapReduce job to the input of some other MapReduce job.

You write a custom partitioner for a Hadoop job, you follow the following path

Create a new class that extends Partitioner Class
Override method getPartition
In the wrapper that runs the MapReduce
Add the custom partitioner to the job by using method set Partitioner Class or – add the custom partitioner to the job as a config file
30) For a job in Hadoop, is it possible to change the number of mappers to be created?

No, it is not possible to change the number of mappers to be created. The number of mappers is determined by the number of input splits.

To store binary key/value pairs, sequence file is used. Unlike regular compressed file, sequence file support splitting even when the data inside the file is compressed.

32) When Namenode is down what happens to job tracker?

Namenode is the single point of failure in HDFS so when Namenode is down your cluster will set off.

33) Explain how indexing in HDFS is done?

Hadoop has a unique way of indexing. Once the data is stored as per the block size, the HDFS will keep on storing the last part of the data which say where the next part of the data will be.

The storage node is the machine or computer where your file system resides to store the processing data
The compute node is the computer or machine where your actual business logic will be executed.
45) Mention what is the use of Context Object?

The Context Object enables the mapper to interact with the rest of the Hadoop

system. It includes configuration data for the job, as well as interfaces which allow it to emit output.

46) Mention what is the next step after Mapper or MapTask?

The next step after Mapper or MapTask is that the output of the Mapper are sorted, and partitions will be created for the output.

47) Mention what is the number of default partitioner in Hadoop?

In Hadoop, the default partitioner is a “Hash” Partitioner.

48) Explain what is the purpose of RecordReader in Hadoop?
