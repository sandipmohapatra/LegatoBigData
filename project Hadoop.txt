we take the use case of analyzing a dataset from Aadhaar – a unique identity issued to all resident Indians. The issuing authority – UIDAI provides a catalog of downloadable datasets collected at the national level. our dataset of interest is “Enrollments processed in detail” which can be downloaded from this link.


Problem Statement:

CSV file contains following columns: Registrar, Enrollment Agency, State, District, Sub District, Pin Code, Gender, Age, Aadhaar Generated, Enrollment Rejected, Residents providing email, Residents providing mobile number
Count the number of Identities generated in each state
Count the number of Identities generated by each Enrollment Agency
Top 10 districts with maximum identities generated for both Male and Female

Solution:
Once the dataset is handy, we first look at the hive query to count the number of Unique Identities generated in each state. As hive runs mapreduce jobs internally, we walkthrough the mapreduce code that is required to compute the state wise identities that are generated.

# TopN-Records
Finding top-N  records from a dataset using MapReduce.
First we discuss the logic of finding top records from a dataset then we generalize it to some 'N'.
